You know you my lil' boo, yeah\nGot up on my Birkin, it's workin'\nShe said she a virgin (It's hurtin')\nShe my biggest fan, she always lurkin'\nShe know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in\nI know she can't stand me, I'm fancy\nSo I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy\nLate night sex, she can't find her panties\nCouldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B\n\n[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay]\nShorty a lil' baddie\nShe my lil' boo thing\nAnd shorty got the fatty (Shorty got the fatty)\nShorty be catching mood swings\nEvery time I fuck without a rubber\nI nutted on her covers\nAnd I kept it undercover\n'Cause I don't kiss and tell",

(To you, to you)\nI don't wanna say, \"I miss you\"\nIf I don't know that you miss me back (Oh no, no)\nI don't wanna say the wrong thing\nIf I do, there's no coming back\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ali Gatie]\nWhat if I told you that I need you?

(Hold me while you wait)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me more, tell me something I don't know\nCould we come close to having it all?\nIf you're gonna waste my time\nLet's waste it right\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd hold me while you wait\nI wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)\nIf only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)\nMy love, my love, my love, my love\nWon't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)\nI wish you cared a little more (Hold me while you wait)\nI wish you'd told me this before (Hold me while you wait)\nMy love, my love, my love, my love\nWon't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is you, this is me, this is all we need\nIs it true? My faith is shaken, but I still believe\nThis is you, this is me, this is all we need\nSo won't you stay a while?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd hold me while you wait\nI wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait)\nIf only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait)\nMy love, my love, my love, my love\nWon't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)\nI wish you cared a little more (Hold me while you wait)\nI wish you'd told me this before (Hold me while you wait)\nMy love, my love, my love, my love\nWon't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait)\n\n[Outro]\nStay a while (Hold me while you wait)\nStay a while (Hold me while you wait)\nMy love, my love, my love\nWon't you stay a while?\n\nIf you wanna help support the channel and earn some free Crypto join CryptoTab with our Affiliate link! :) https://cryptotabbrowser.com/15042256",

Go pick it out\nMy wallet looking bigger than my belly now\nGirl what a shame, they slept on me\nThey‚Äôre coming back, and now they crawling on their knees\nAin‚Äôt nothing changed, same old me\nCame up on some change, but that doesn‚Äôt change a thing \n\nI‚Äôm so used to being broke, but not no more\nI‚Äôm buying all the things I never could afford\nLike what the hell, top shelf\nWe gonna toast tonight to temporary wealth\nMama told me baby save it, knowing me I probably won‚Äôt\nAll this money in my pocket gotta go, I‚Äôm so used to being broke. \n\nAirbnb, up in the hills\nIt costs as much as little brothers college bills\nLike seven rooms, called all my friends\nThey on the way across the country in a van \nYou know I can‚Äôt promise that this is going to last forever\nbut since I got it, we all gonna spend it together \n\nI‚Äôm so used to being broke, but not no more\nI‚Äôm buying all the things I never could afford\nLike what the hell, top shelf\nWe gonna toast tonight to temporary wealth\nMama told me baby save it, knowing me I probably won‚Äôt\nAll this money in my pocket gotta go, I‚Äôm so used to being broke.\n\n#TeddySwims #Broke\n\n00:00 Teddy Swims - Broke\n00:05 Lyrics In The Description",
